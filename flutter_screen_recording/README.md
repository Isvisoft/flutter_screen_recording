<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_INTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

To your Android Manifest, under the `<application>` tag, add the following:
```xml
<service
	android:name="com.foregroundservice.ForegroundService"
	android:foregroundServiceType="mediaProjection">
</service>
```

## iOS

	<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Save video in gallery</string>
	<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Save audio in video</string>
